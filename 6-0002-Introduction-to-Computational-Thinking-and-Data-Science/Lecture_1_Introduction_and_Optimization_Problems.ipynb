    "Often presented in a way: \"Imagine being a burglar wanting to maximize the stolen property, but You only have a knapsack with a certain volume and can select only certain items.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have limited strength, so there is a maximum weight knapsack that you can carry.\n",
    "2. You would like to take more stuff than You can carry.\n",
    "3. How to choose which stuff to take and what to leave behind.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. 0/1 knapsack problem - take a whole bar of gold or take none of it\n",

    "1. Each item is represented by a pair ```<value, weight>```\n",

    "3. Vector L, of length n represents the set of available items. Each element of the vector is an item.\n",
    "4. Vector V, of length n, used to indicate whether or not items are taken. If ```V[i] = 1```, item ```I[i]``` is taken. If ```V[i] = 0```, item ```I[i]``` is not taken\n",
